##### Project Aims:
######  *(click to expand)*
<details> 
<ul>I chose to examine what if any relationsships existed in the following:</ul>
<ul>1) Examine any overall trends in countries and medals won for both Summer and Winter Olympic Games</ul> 
<ul>2) Determine if any trends emerge for teams winning seasonal events for countries that favour such activities due to geography and climate</ul>
<ul>3) Determine if any trends emerged over time for medals won, participating countries</ul>
</details>
  
##### Data Set and Data Cleaning Process 
###### *(click to expand)*
<details>
<ul> Dataset is publicly available and consists of 2 separate .csv files for Olympic Events participants and Medals won from 1900 to 2016</ul>
<ul>Initial data set examination was performed with Pandas and Excel to look for general features of interest & potential problems with the data</ul>
<ul>Significant data cleaning and formatting was required to prepare the data for further evaluation, examples include:</ul> 
<li>creating consistency in names, accounting for historical changes (e.g. East Germany, USSR etc), separating data points for better evaluation</li>
